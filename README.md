# Defiance Loadout Switcher Script for AutoHotKey #

## Introduction ##

This AHK script provides functions that you can call from your own scripts to switch any one of the 5 loadouts. Currently the script is hard coded to expect a 1920×1080 (1080p) screen resolution. I'm working on a way to make the script work with any screen resolution. 

## Functions ##

There are 5 functions defined in the script that you can call from your own AHK scripts

SelectLoadout1()

SelectLoadout2()

SelectLoadout3()

SelectLoadout4()

SelectLoadout5()

## Getting Started ##
